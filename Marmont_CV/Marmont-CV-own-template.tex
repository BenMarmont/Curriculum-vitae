\section{Objective}\label{objective}

Following the completion of my Master's in Management (Economics) at the
University of Waikato, I have honed my expertise as an Economist at
DairyNZ, gaining valuable insights into Agricultural Economics, the
Dairy sector, and related primary industries. My goal is to leverage and
expand this expertise via a PhD, continuing to apply and enhance the
skills and knowledge I have developed.

  Econ Tracker}

  \href{https://connect.dairynz.co.nz/2022-23_Dairy_Statistics/}{Dairy
  Statistics} after the publication was transitioned from LIC to DairyNZ
\item

\subsection{Master of Management (Economics, First Class
Honours)}\label{master-of-management-economics-first-class-honours}

\textbf{University of Waikato, 2018 - 2020}

My research investigated a novel approach to methane mitigation in NZ's
dairy industry utilising in-paddock smart-feeders as a delivery
mechanism for methane inhibitors. It contains two distinct pieces, the
adoption-diffusion of the approach throughout NZ's dairy farming
population and the approach's economic performance in different
scenarios. Each piece utilised modelling to quantify the approach.
